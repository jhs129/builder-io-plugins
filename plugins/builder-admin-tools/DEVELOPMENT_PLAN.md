```

### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface Space {
  name: string;
  publicKey: string;
  privateKey: string;
}

interface Model {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  kind: string;
  fields?: any[];
  helperText?: string;
  subFields?: any[];
}
```

### API Integration
- **GraphQL Endpoint**: `https://builder.io/api/v2/admin`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with private API key
- **Queries**: GetAllModels for fetching model data
- **Mutations**: CreateModel for model synchronization

## Development Notes

### Build & Deployment
- Use `npm run build` to compile the plugin
- Plugin loads as `plugin.system.js` in Builder.io
- CSS is bundled and processed through PostCSS
- All dependencies are externalized for plugin compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Incremental component testing in browser
- Real API integration testing with actual Builder.io spaces
- Error handling validation with invalid credentials
- Performance testing with large model sets

### Known Issues & Solutions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Not compatible with plugin environment - solved with custom CSS
- **MobX Observables**: Required special extraction logic for plugin settings
- **Webpack Externals**: Needed to remove @orlandohealth dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 6: Model Selection UI
2. Add confirmation dialogs for safety
3. Implement content purging functionality
4. Add operation history and undo capabilities

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Plugin loads without errors
- âœ… Real API calls work with proper authentication
- âœ… Model synchronization creates actual models
- âœ… Professional UI matches Builder.io design standards
- âœ… Error handling provides clear user feedback
